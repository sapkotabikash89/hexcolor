                Welcome to <strong>ColorMean</strong>, your dedicated space for exploring the deeper side of colors. We focus on the meaning, symbolism, psychology, spirituality, and technical structure of colors, all in one place. Our goal is simple. To help you understand how colors influence thoughts, emotions, culture, and visual communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                Color is not only what we see. It shapes how we feel, how we react, and how we express identity. At ColorMean, we study color from both an emotional and a technical point of view to give you a complete picture.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">Our Mission</h2>
              <p>
                Our mission is to build a <strong>trusted global reference</strong> for color meaning and color data. We want artists, designers, students, spiritual seekers, and curious minds to find accurate and meaningful color insights without confusion.
              </p>
              <p>We focus on:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Color meanings and symbolism</li>
                <li>Psychological and emotional impact of colors</li>
                <li>Spiritual and cultural interpretations</li>

              </ul>
              <p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">What Makes ColorMean Different</h2>
              <p>
                Many websites talk about colors only from a design angle. We go further.
              </p>
              <p>At ColorMean, we connect:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Emotion with data</li>
                <li>Spiritual meaning with visual science</li>
                <li>Cultural symbolism with modern color systems</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This allows you to see colors not only as digital values but as tools of expression, identity, and influence.
              </p>
              <p>We also structure our content so that it is:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
